                <!-- <img src="../images/book-and-flower.jpeg" alt=""> -->
            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <p>I am a person who gets really annoyed at trivial things. For example, I probably examined 
                    every single word in this post to make sure it was the best way to explain my thoughts. 
                    Two years ago, I made an entire Google Doc of all the things I don&#39;t like. Every so 
                    often, I go back, add new things, and change some wording. You see, that's the 
                    “examining every single word” thing.
                </p>

                <p>But I was wondering, why do I seem to be the only one who is bothered by such things? Like
                    obviously if someone is doing these things, they either don&#39;t know or don&#39;t find 
                    it strange. Why have I developed the ability to notice every detail?
                </p>

                <p>So I went through that three-page list again and sorted everything into categories. I mean, 
                    there was no way anybody would read the whole three pages. And we will start with the 
                    stationery/school section, since it is the one where people commit the most faults.
                </p>


                <ul class="blog-list">
                    
                <li class="blog-list-item"> when people fold a stapled packet not close to the staple — doesn&#39;t 
                    it cut off some of the writing?
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> stapling papers too far from the edge or not stapling it 45 degrees 
                    diagonally — if you staple it horizontally or vertically, how will you fold it correctly?
                </li>

                <p>And I didn&#39;t know it could get worse than horizontal or vertical. One time I volunteered 
                    to help my teacher staple some papers that were just printed, and the other girl was 
                    stapling them in the opposite diagonal. I felt bad for anyone who got those packets
                </p>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> when a packet is stapled but the edges aren&#39;t even lined up 
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> detaching the first page of a stapled packet by ripping it off except 
                    you did it wrong and the corner of the paper is left behind
                </li>

                </ul>
                
                <p>I think you can see that staples need to be very specific
                </p>

                <ul class="blog-list">
                <li class="blog-list-item"> papers in binders getting ripped where the hole punches were
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> bent corners in a book — I used to fold the corners of books when I 
                    didn&#39;t have a bookmark. But now that I think about it, why did I do that?
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> using the eraser on a mechanical pencil until it is flat and you can no 
                    longer take the eraser out to refill the pencil lead
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> when there is half an inch of lead left but the mechanical pencil refuses to let you use it
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> when people don&#39;t push in the lead after using their mechanical pencil 
                    so the edge of their pencil pouch is really dirty
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> when people use the wrong side of binder paper — it&#39;s so dumb and if 
                    you ever need to put that thing in a binder, it will be the wrong way.
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> when people don&#39;t leave a margin on the right side of lined paper
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> when my handwriting changes throughout the notebook — it&#39;s inevitable but still annoying
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> when people hole punch papers but the middle hole punch isn&#39;t in the middle — if you put the 
                    papers in a binder, the top/bottom edges of the papers will not be lined up and that&#39;s so 
                    annoying to look at
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> when dividers or folders stick out of binders
                </li>

                <li class="blog-list-item"> when glue sticks have dried glue on them — it becomes disgusting and affects the cap closing. 
                    And you shouldn&#39;t be twisting so much of the glue out to the point where it goes over the edge
                </li>
