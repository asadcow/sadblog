                <p>I still can&#39;t believe I&#39;m starting high school in a week. Over the summer, 
                    I played golf with people who were 1 or 2 years older than me, and some 
                    of them have asked me if I&#39;m excited for high school to start.
                </p>

                <p>I suppose it would be nice to have some structure in my life again. To compensate for waking 
                    up at 6 AM for golf tournaments, I&#39;ve been sleeping until 9 on other days. But I&#39;m also 
                    worried about the workload. I didn&#39;t have many classes this summer, and  I&#39;ve spent 
                    most of my time immersing myself in Olympic gymnastics and Minecraft.
                </p>

                <p>My brother is starting middle school, and he has orientation tomorrow. I don&#39;t remember 
                    much from the start of 6th grade. However, I found this piece that I wrote
                    two hours after my "second" middle school orientation happened. What does that mean? Well,
                    I was a part of WEB—Where Everybody Belongs. It&#39;s a middle 
                    school transition program where the trained WEB leaders, who are 8th graders, facilitate
                    activities during orientation and other events.
                </p>

                <p class="section-separator">------------------------------</p>
                <p class="centered-heading">WEB: Where Everybody Belongs, Faces their Fears, and Avoids the G-Word</p>
                <p>[This is not the original writing. Some sections have been revised as needed.]
                </p>

                <p>On the Friday before school started, over a hundred nervous or maybe excited 6th graders 
                    walked into the school gym for their first taste of middle school: orientation. Obviously, 
                    I went through 6th grade orientation too. Maybe they didn&#39;t know, but I felt the same 
                    emotions because we were leading an event I had never experienced myself… 
                </p>
                
                <p>During the pandemic when we couldn&#39;t have 200 people in one room, we didn&#39;t get to 
                    walk under a cheering human tunnel while entering the gym. And I&#39;ve never had the 
                    opportunity to be part of organizing a major welcoming event. But when our school announced 
                    the WEB application in the spring of 7th grade, I felt the need to join so I could finally 
                    do something to benefit our school&#39;s community while developing leadership skills. Being 
                    a WEB leader felt like the perfect way to practice. I remembered how lost I felt 
                    on the first day of school without my elementary school friends and wanted to make sure the 
                    6th graders didn&#39;t feel too confused.
                </p>

                <p> The first thirty minutes of orientation were held in the gym, which was covered in resurrected 
                    welcome signs. We, the WEB leaders and 6th graders, met each other in fun ways (“say everything 
                    you did in the last 24 hours, but in reverse order”) and watched ten brave volunteers 
                    participate in a relay race of popping balloons.
                </p>

                <p>After that segment, we broke off into our groups and led the students to our assigned classrooms. 
                    We took turns leading different activities, and each exercise had an intended purpose, including 
                    handling teamwork challenges, learning about classmates, and discussing strategies for school 
                    success. Training for this took the longest. To see what the games 
                    looked like, we, the WEB leaders, took the position of the students, and the WEB advisors read 
                    the instructions to us. After these initial introductions came practice—lots of it. We knew
                    the activities so well that we kept doing the next step before the instructions were read. However,
                    the 6th graders wouldn&#39;t know the activities, and we had to be mindful of that while practicing.
                </p>

                <p>During training, we were reminded not to use the word “game” when describing these activities, since 
                    “game” implies a winner and a loser. However, this was difficult for some of the activities, 
                    including One Left, which was structured just like a game. This activity used 15 straws, and the 
                    objective was to take turns picking up either 1, 2, or 3 straws so that you don&#39;t pick up the 
                    last straw. The leader was supposed to play “against” the 6th graders and win each time because 
                    we knew the strategy. Afterward, we would reveal the specific strategy and then play a few more 
                    rounds, showing how strategies could be helpful. However, [partner 1] kept calling the 
                    activity a game. We even got the 6th graders to laugh and remind him to say “activity” instead.
                </p>

                <p>All of the activities were designed to lead into the next one. So as a joke, I announced, “Ok, so 
                    now we are going to move onto the next lecture—oh no, I meant activity—where we will be discussing 
                    success strategies for middle school!” The students received their schedules and planners during 
                    this activity. During training, we looked through their schedules so we could show the 6th graders 
                    their classroom locations. We were reminded not to call any teacher “good” or “bad,” as “none of 
                    the teachers are bad. They just teach in different ways” -WEB advisors. 
                </p>

                <p>The next part of orientation was the campus tour led by WEB leaders. The leaders of each group planned 
                    routes that showed the location of every classroom and other key places like the lunch lines, library, 
                    and the blacktop. When we encountered other groups, we yelled our unique chant, created by [partner 
                    1]: “Ooga booga, ooga booga, ooga booga, EDINBURGH!” After a few of these exchanges, part of me 
                    wished that we had just created a normal chant like everyone else, e.g., “ALCAZAR! ALCAZAR! ALCAZAR!” 
                    I&#39;m pretty sure [partner 2] felt the same.
                </p>

                <p>Besides all the practicing of our small group roles and hosting the actual event, I finally experienced 
                    the thoughtful preparation went in behind the scenes. For example, we helped to hang up welcoming posters 
                    and set up check-in tables in the gym. We also met other WEB leaders and built a strong team by playing 
                    games—no wait, they&#39;re activities. In fact, most of the first training day revolved around team 
                    building. 
                </p>

                <p>Another task we completed was to (phone) call each sixth grader in our groups to remind them about 
                    orientation. I&#39;m always overly worried about calling the wrong number, and it did not help that 
                    we were supposed to talk directly with kids not much younger than us in an adult&#39;s tone and without 
                    scaring them. Nevertheless, I did eventually face my fears.
                </p>

                <p>Overall, being part of orientation was a memorable and enjoyable experience. I learned the tremendous 
                    efforts others invest to prepare for successful school events, and I got to spend time around other people 
                    with leadership qualities. I hope that by being a part of WEB, I can learn how to talk with others.
