            <div class="container">
                <p>Basically, I coded this blog with HTML/CSS/Javascript. On my own MacBook Air with VS Code. I know 
                    I have stupid ideas. But I did code it. Really.
                </p>

                <p>Now, I&#39;m really not that good at programming. I haven&#39;t passed USACO Bronze yet, and I never 
                    learned Javascript. But I&#39;ve always wanted to make a blog. And ever since I learned HTML and CSS, 
                    I&#39;ve always thought it wouldn&#39;t be genuine if I made my blog with an online website builder.
                </p>

                <p>I was not sure which one would have been a bigger obstacle: my lack of skill, or the fact that all of 
                    the good features on website builders are behind a paywall. 

                <p>So I chose to code it myself. I found a YouTube tutorial (it&#39;s linked in my about section) and 
                    “took inspiration” from it. Which is synonymous with “copied a lot of it.” If you go to the video, 
                    you&#39;ll see many similarities. But with my small understanding of web development, I was able to 
                    figure out what most of the code in the video did and adapt it for my needs.
                </p>

                <p>When I was first coding this blog, I think I spent about 2 hours per day for like 6 days. And since I 
                    used VS Code, I got used to using command+s to save the changes. So when I went over to the online IDE 
                    that I use for C++ (I couldn&#39;t get VS Code to work), I kept using command+s. And when I wrote my 
                    posts on a Google Doc, I used command+s. Except it doesn&#39;t do anything on Google Docs. And on the 
                    online IDE, it&#39;s the shortcut to download the code on your computer. Which was annoying.
                </p>

                <p> As I have expanded the number of posts and categories on this blog, I&#39;ve had to add more to the 
                    navigation bar. I also edited the footer a few times. And it&#39;s a pain in the ass to do, really. I 
                    have to go through every single one of the HTML files and change them all. As this post is being drafted, 
                    it is 6 posts, 5 tags, the about page, and the home page. That&#39;s like 13 pages. And I&#39;ll have to 
                    do it again when I finally come up with a name for this blog. I mean, if you&#39;re reading this now, it 
                    will have a name. But right now, I don&#39;t know the name. So everywhere you see the name of my blog, it 
                    was “blog name” for like 4 months and got replaced in a very tedious process.
                </p>

                <p>I also update a lot of things for each post, like the home page and tags. And then for the post, I duplicate 
                    the previous one so the navigation bar and footer are there, but I have to remember to change all of the dates 
                    and titles. And the one I have been forgetting recently is changing the name of the tab. So if you opened 
                    every post on separate tabs, they would all say “WEB Orientation.” Great.
                </p>

                <p>Because of all of this that I have to do, I feel like if I can&#39;t make a good enough post, I just won&#39;t. 
                    It&#39;s not worth going through all of that for a two-paragraph post. So that&#39;s why my posts are like 
                    twice a month, a few days late, and really long.
                </p>

                <p>The big problem is that I don&#39;t know how to use any frameworks like React. Hell, I don't know how to write
                    a single line of Javascript, and I currently don&#39;t have the time to study it myself on top of school, golf,
                    and competitive programming. I know I&#39;m dumb for making a website with this many pages while being so
                    inexperienced. And since I know I&#39;m dumb, I will wait until I learn Javascript and rewrite all of the
                    code before finally uploading this site to GitHub Pages or something like that. It might be a next summer.
                </p>

                <p>1/27/25 update: I haven't actually redone the Javascript or named this blog. </p>

                <p> Now it just seems like I&#39;m complaining. But I do enjoy doing this sometimes. Occasionally, writing is fun. 
                    And coding is fun. More fun than doing my math homework during my free period. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m still 
                    here. Besides, I&#39;ve learned quite a bit as I have been doing this. But I still think “media queries” is a dumb 
                    name that doesn&#39;t really describe what it does.
                </p>

                <p>So I lied in my last post. I said I would post about kpop or school this time. But I didn&#39;t. I&#39;ve just 
                    written about programming. Hopefully you can tell. But I promise I will write about kpop or school eventually. If 
                    the essay I just turned in last night gets a good grade, I might post it. And I might post about Babymonster,
                    or maybe try to get into more girl groups and write my opinions about their songs.
                </p>
                
                <p>I&#39;ll have to see what future me does.</p>
