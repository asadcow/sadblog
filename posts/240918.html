                <p>In my fourth grade class, my teacher bought a new book for our class library every week. One of 
                    the books was titled “Insignificant Events in the Life of a Cactus.” We only had one copy of 
                    the book for 30 students who wanted to read it, so I think it was about two months before I 
                    finally had the chance. However, there was a problem.
                </p>

                <p>I didn&#39;t know what the word “insignificant” meant.
                </p>

                <p>As we are taught in school, I tried to use context clues. Aven says her moving to Arizona 
                    (or was it her birth?) was an insignificant event in the life of this old cactus. The girl 
                    and her family worked a lot to fix Stagecoach Pass, which would change the scenery forever 
                    and bring many people to the area. So insignificant probably means important!!
                </p>

                <p>I was so inspired by this book that I decided to make a list of the most “insignificant events” 
                    in my life. I think I included all of my violin competitions and my best golf score at the 
                    time, which was 92 on a par 60 course (for context: it&#39;s not actually that good). 
                </p>

                <p>Since then, I have learned the definition of insignificant. With my new knowledge, I will try 
                    again after 4 years and finally make a <em>proper</em> list of insignificant events in my life.
                </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> I did a relatively difficult math problem correctly
                </p>

                <p>I fell asleep with 30 needles stuck in my back (aka acupuncture)
                </p>

                <p>I learned how to say adapt in Chinese (适应)
                </p>

                <p>I cut my arm with a razor 
                </p>

                <p>I washed my hair on June 18, 2022
                </p>

                <p>I ran 800m and did 20 crunches in PE 
                </p>

                <p>I listened to Babymonster yesterday
                </p>

                <p>I drank 4 cups of milk one day
                </p>

                <p>I didn&#39;t go to school on March 22, 2024
                </p>

                <p>I hit a golf ball into the water
                </p>

                <p>I walked to 7-Eleven from my school to buy Ice Breakers Duo, M&Ms, and Nerds
                </p>

                <p>I almost choked on said Nerds
                </p>

                <p>I wrote this list, thinking it was the funniest thing in the world
                </p>

                <p class="section-separator">------------------------------</p>

                <p> is this a "proper list" if i didn't even use an html list?
                </p>

                <p> i say it is </p>
