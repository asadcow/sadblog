                <p>Warning: spoilers. And if you have never watched Grian&#39;s life series, Hermitcraft, or anything 
                    similar, you will have no idea what any of this means.
                </p>

                <p>today, saturday, october 19, at about 8:45 am PST, i found smallishbeans&#39;s new youtube video, 
                    and i saw “wild life” in the title. interesting. and i accidentally spoiled it for myself with 
                    a comment that mentioned how bdubs was the first one to find out about the shrinking. i had no 
                    idea what that meant, but… interesting.
                </p>

                <p>after the initial introduction, i thought the series was gonna be like afterlife smp where you were 
                    randomly assigned an origin for each life. but i think the actual mechanic is a lot more interesting 
                    and unique. i&#39;m always impressed by how grian comes up with the concepts.

                <p>joel, gem, and bdubs were in a forest when they discovered the wildcard. bdubs shrunk to a size even 
                    shorter than one block, it was funny how he said he was “sinking” while it happened. and i was a bit 
                    scared since when they tried to jump to unshrink, there was no noticeable difference. but later in 
                    the video, lizzie was absolutely massive after jumping, so it&#39;s definitely possible to unshrink.
                </p>

                <p>i also think it&#39;s interesting that they had 6 lives. i wonder if some of the wildcards in later 
                    episodes will make them more prone to taking damage? because why else would they need 6?
                </p>

                <p> i&#39;m really excited for the joel and gem team. i enjoyed watching them team at the beginning of 
                    real life (there&#39;s an animation of joel immensely struggling with VR and i watched that many times) 
                    and everything sort of fell apart when they split. so i hope they stick together in this series and win.
                </p>

                <p>i used to keep up with all of minecraft&#39;s updates (like since 2021) and i knew a lot of minecraft 
                    mechanics. but i didn&#39;t watch minecraft live this year. so when they went into the pale forest or 
                    whatever it&#39;s called, i had no idea what they were trying to do. i just knew that there was this 
                    creature that has to be killed in a strange way and you have to be constantly looking at it.
                </p>

                <p>so now it is a few days later, and i have been watching grian&#39;s episode. i really like sub 1 club&#39;s 
                    vibes and it was funny when they went mining and kept taking damage. but what is their team name for the
                    next episode? surely it won&#39;t be another size wildcard.
                </p>

                <p>i&#39;ll just say that i&#39;m definitely not gonna write a post every single week. but i&#39;m planning 
                    to write about wild life after it ends. and the next post will either be about school or babymonster's 
                    new album when it releases. yay
