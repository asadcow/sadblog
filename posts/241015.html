                <p>I remember watching TwoSet marvel over Sohyun Ko playing Zigeunerweisen, showing my mom how 
                    a 12-year-old girl was better at violin than these two guys. And how my mom gave me a 
                    reality check by saying that Brett and Eddy were better than me.
                </p>

                <p>I remember thinking that their Asian mom skits were the funniest videos ever. I shared them 
                    with my friends at the time and we tried to imitate the accent.
                </p>

                <p>I remember binging their videos when I was a sad kid during distance learning: their old skits, 
                    violin charades, Ling Ling workouts, the lofi making video, and the violin vs bass battle. I 
                    was starting to become bored of playing the violin, but TwoSet motivated me to practice more often.
                </p>

                <p>I remember tuning in to Eddy&#39;s Sibelius 3 mil livestream with my family after online school 
                    ended that day. It was probably the only time I have ever watched anything on YouTube together 
                    with my mom.
                </p>

                <p>I thought it was hilarious when my non-Twosetter friend realized that TwoSetViolin was called 
                    TwoSetViolin because it was two guys who both played the violin.
                </p>

                <p> Since my parents weren&#39;t really into classical music, I wouldn&#39;t have known anything if 
                    it weren&#39;t for TwoSet. When my teacher gave me the sheet music for Sarasate&#39;s Introduction 
                    and Tarantella last month, it felt so familiar that I thought I had to have played the piece 
                    before. But actually, it was familiar because I heard it over and over again in TwoSet videos.
                </p>

                <p>And thanks to TwoSet, interesting is the first adjective that comes to my mind.
                </p>

                <p>Yesterday morning, I came across TwoSet&#39;s last Instagram post. I was quite confused, since it 
                    was so sudden and I just had one of their recent videos recommended to me a few days before. And 
                    didn&#39;t they also prank us in a similar way for April Fools? I was not so convinced that 
                    TwoSet was quitting. Besides, r/lingling40hrs further fueled my false hopes and convinced me that 
                    they were just rebranding.
                </p>

                <p>I wish their videos weren&#39;t taken down, as I would love to be watching them now. But unfortunately,
                    we have to move on.
