            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <p>My interest in MBTI has been mostly on and off in the past three years. After all, it&#39;s not 
                    like sports, where there are competitions every year to keep up with. But I still find it super 
                    fascinating and I enjoy learning about it.
                </p>

                <p>My first introduction to MBTI was from a TwoSetViolin video, titled “How the 16 MBTI Personality 
                    Types Make Music.” And obviously, I didn&#39;t know what any of the letters meant. Like ENTJ… 
                    what is that supposed to mean? Are they just four random letters of the alphabet?
                </p>

                <p>Now I don&#39;t remember what I did after that. I mean, I was in 5th grade, and this was when I 
                    learned how to “secretly” watch YouTube in bed with the lights off until 1 am. So my lack of 
                    sleep is probably one reason why I have like no memory of this time. But I probably just searched 
                    up MBTI that same day and then decided to take the test from 16Personalities. And my result was ENTP-T.
                </p>

                <p>So then I learned about the dichotomies. Extraversion vs introversion, sensing vs intuition, thinking 
                    vs feeling, judging vs perceiving, turbulent vs assertive. So I thought about my result. Hmmm, I&#39;m 
                    probably an extravert because I like talking to people most of the time. And I use logic all the time, 
                    so T makes sense for me. And I don&#39;t plan things a lot, so I&#39;m definitely perceiving (P). And 
                    turbulent makes sense as well, like I have a constant need to improve, I&#39;m a perfectionist, and I 
                    have impostor syndrome to a certain extent.
                </p>

                <p>But sensing vs intuition? I was like 11 years old, and I didn&#39;t understand what those words meant. 
                    So I just trusted the test results. To be fair, there are still some words on the 16Personalities 
                    test that I have to look up every time. I think my brain is just too small for those words. 
                </p>
                
                <p>My second phase of interest in MBTI was a year later when I was 12. I&#39;m pretty sure I was on 
                    vacation in Hawaii when I decided to take the 16Personalities test again. My result was… ISTP. So I 
                    was like what? How did two letters change? And I don&#39;t fit the stereotype of being a mechanic 
                    or craftsman. Is this right?
                </p>

                <p> I asked my friend group at that time if they thought I was more like an ENTP or an ISTP. But I don&#39;t 
                    think anyone really wants to read two whole articles just to tell their really cringe friend what 
                    personality type they were. Then they all shared their MBTI types, which I found fascinating. I 
                    think I still have the post-it where I wrote them down, even if I don&#39;t hang out with all of 
                    these people anymore.
                </p>

                <p>I also discovered Frank James on YouTube. I really liked watching his comedy sketches, and I always tried 
                    to see if I related to the ENTP or ISTP parts. Then, I learned about the cognitive functions (btw I 
                    still think his video explains it pretty well, if you want to watch it). It was like an entire new 
                    realization for me. Like I thought it was so cool that MBTI was essentially two different systems. The 
                    simpler, surface level one being dichotomies, and the more big-brain-people one being the cognitive 
                    functions. But why did it take me a whole year to discover what it was?
                </p>

                <p>I think once I learned about the cognitive functions, I started calling myself an MBTI nerd. You can see 
                    it in the identity web project I did at the start of the year in language arts. I was desperately trying 
                    to come up with 20 things, so one of them was “ISTP” and another was “interested in MBTI.”
                </p>

                <p>However, it added another level of confusion for me when determining my own personality type. Especially 
                    when you have to factor in loops, grips, and certain functions being not as developed. And I recently 
                    read that sometimes, people&#39;s dominant functions are so natural to them that they don&#39;t even 
                    realize they are using it. So I could be an Fi dom without even knowing! That&#39;s kind of weird, since 
                    I&#39;ve been so convinced that I&#39;m a thinker.
                </p>

                <p>I still tell people I&#39;m an ISTP. Because to this day, I still don&#39;t have a good answer. And I 
                    suppose I just have to accept that for now. I shouldn&#39;t take it too seriously, since my personality is 
                    probably going to change as I go through high school and stuff. It&#39;s sort of hard to get an accurate 
                    result as a teenager.
                </p>

                <p>But there&#39;s still hope. Maybe I can convince one of my friends to learn the cognitive functions, and 
                    then get them to type me. Then maybe, I can finally come to a conclusion for this question that has been 
                    in the back of my mind for the past 3 years.
                </p>
