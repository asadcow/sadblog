                <p>Here&#39;s the promised continuation to my post, “<u><a href="241025.html">NEW LIFE SERIES</a></u>.” 
                    It might have sounded like I was talking about a TV series called 
                    “New Life.” I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a real series. But it&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about. 
                </p>

                <p>Here, I wrote my comments for episodes 3, 4, and 5 (forgot to do it for Episode 2). Episode 6 was 
                    released recently, but that will have to be in Part 2 with the future episodes since this post is 
                    already long.
                </p>

                <p class="smaller-left-heading">★ Episode 3: Snails

                <p>In my last post about this series, I said:                  
                </p>

                <blockquote class = "quote">
                    <p>
                        <span><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span>
                        i also think it&#39;s interesting that they had 6 lives. i wonder if some of the wildcards in later 
                        episodes will make them more prone to taking damage? because why else would they need 6?
                        <span><i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i></span>
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>But after the chaos that was this session, this series could be as short as Double Life. It&#39;s 
                    impressive how Gem, Joel, Scott, Cleo, and Lizzie did not die to their snails, yet Jimmy, Scar, and 
                    Skizz managed to die so many times. Also, the skins of each snail and the sounds were so well designed. 
                    So was the name of Scar&#39;s snail (eSCARgo). I didn&#39;t understand it at first, but upon searching 
                    up, I realized it&#39;s escargot (snails as food; didn&#39;t know that before), and now I think it&#39;s 
                    by far the smartest name.
                </p>

                <p class="smaller-left-heading"> ★ Episode 4: Speeding Up
                </p>

                <p>This was a very needed change after the amount of deaths in the previous session. Some of the snail deaths 
                    were entertaining, but I think traps or double/triple kills are better. I was confused when everything froze 
                    in the beginning. It would&#39;ve been even better if Skizz jumped down a little earlier, since him stopping 
                    10 blocks above ground would&#39;ve been so funny.
                </p>

                <p>I was sad when Joel died to Jimmy, especially since creeper web kills don&#39;t really allow the person to 
                    defend themselves. But I realize that the creepers and cobwebs would&#39;ve taken time to gather, so fair 
                    play. Plus, maybe it&#39;s just that I&#39;m a Joel supporter, and that&#39;s why I was sad.
                </p>

                <p>But Mumbo&#39;s lava bucket death, that was funny. He always finds the dumbest ways to die. The way he jumped 
                    off the car, thinking Grian could save him, but he took several hearts of fall damage and probably could&#39;ve
                    survived if he didn&#39;t.
                </p>

                <p class="smaller-left-heading"> ★ Episode 5: Trivia Bot
                </p>

                <p>It was slightly stressful when the lifers struggled with easy questions. Some of them I didn&#39;t even think 
                    could be answered wrong. And Mumbo apparently thinks he was in Third Life and Second Life. Very entertaining 
                    non-existent season, Second Life. 
                </p>

                <p>I got around 70 of the questions right when I did the form. Which I think is decent considering these are the 
                    POVs I watched. TL (3L?): none recently. Last Life: Jimmy a while ago, Joel. DL: Jimmy, Tango, Joel, Grian? 
                    a while ago. Limited Life: all three bad boys, Impulse first 3 episodes. SL: Joel.
                </p>

                <p>I can see why I&#39;m a top 0.4% Joel viewer.
                </p>

                <p>Regarding the rewards for answering questions correctly, I thought they were just a little bit OP. Several 
                    tridents and maces, lots of wind charges and ender pearls, powered rails for TNT minecarts, etc. But the 
                    fact that the maces only had one durability (I think) sort of balanced it out, and Mumbo&#39;s mace kill was 
                    amazing. If only he didn&#39;t die like 3 times this episode…
                </p>

                <p>I&#39;m so sad about Mumbo being the first out, especially since his last two deaths were so stupid. Why did 
                    he literally walk off the tower? And why did he stand in front of the minecart? I can&#39;t tell which is 
                    dumber: letting a minecart crash into you or getting stuck on your own fence posts while escaping a warden. 
                    If I had a nickel for every time Mumbo&#39;s final death in a life series was directly or indirectly caused 
                    by an object he placed, I&#39;d have two nickels. Which isn&#39;t a lot but it&#39;s enough to annoy Jimmy 
                    SolidarityGaming who hates the nickel meme format. Sorry Jimmy.
                </p>

                <p>Anyway that&#39;s all.
